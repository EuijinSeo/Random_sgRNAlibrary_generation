# Generation of an Ultra-dense Genome-scale Single-guide RNA Library for CRISPRi Application
In our study, 'Generation of an Ultra-dense Genome-scale Single-guide RNA Library for CRISPRi Application', we conducted high-throughput phenotypic screenings to find essential genes and auxotrophic genes of Escherichia coli by CRISPRi using enzymatically generated sgRNA. Here, we present the code used in this study for analysis of NGS data; matching the reads from control and selective conditions, calculating the reads per sgRNAs and characterization of the sgRNA library.
